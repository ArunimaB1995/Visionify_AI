# Visionify_AI
use a simple object detection model (with your choice of PyTorch or Tensorflow). Implement object tracking for the objects detected from frame-to-frame. Use your choice of algorithm for object tracking (I am okay with a simple centroid based object tracking). If two people are in the frame, then count them as two different people (Person#1 and Person#2). A person going out of frame and coming back can be counted as a new object. Show a box on the object detected, and print person number on each detection.
