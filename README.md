## Using a simple object detection model: 
Implementation of object tracking for the objects detected from frame-to-frame. Use your choice of algorithm for object tracking (with a simple centroid based object tracking and MobileNetSSD). If two people are in the frame, then counting them as two different people (Person#1 and Person#2). A person going out of frame and coming back can be counted as a new object. 
Displaying a box on the object detected, and printing person number on each detection.
